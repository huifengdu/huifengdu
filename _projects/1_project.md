The older population (85+) in the United States is expected to more than double from 6.7 to 14.4 million by 2040. Even before COVID-19, weekly death counts in long-term care facilities could spike by up to 5,000 during seasonal flu outbreaks. Our recent participation in the NSF National I-Corps program revealed the urgent need for rapid on-site, airborne pathogen detection for preemptive action against air-transmissible infectious diseases, well before contagious individuals show symptoms. This applies both to future pandemics and to endemic viral diseases, such as influenza and COVID-19, which hit vulnerable populations yearly with severe consequences. The ultra-low concentrations of virus in the air make airborne virus detection difficult, yet readily infect individuals.

We characterized a fieldable biosensing process that incorporates a fast RNA enrichment step in order to concentrate viral RNA in a small volume prior to RT-qPCR. Our process was integrated with pathogen collection using a compact, inexpensive, ESP air sampler, as a stand-alone system for early detection of airborne pathogens. To extract the viral RNA, we implemented a simple heat-extraction protocol to circumvent the need for commercial extraction kits, overall making the platform field-ready and relatively inexpensive. Following heat extraction, we developed and characterized an enrichment system which uses small channel electrophoresis against a semipermeable membrane. This system is able to concentrate RNA by nearly 5-fold in just 10 minutes. We designed this process to be simple, inexpensive, and fieldable, thus making continuous monitoring in low-resource settings viable. {% cite du2024fieldable %}

To refine our value proposition and bridge the gaps between research and practical considerations, we participated in the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps program. During the six-week period, we conducted over 110 interviews with long-term care facilities administrations, residents, infection control staff, doctors, epidemiologists, advocacy groups, technology start-up founders and academic researchers. We made site-visits to the nursing homes and assisted living communities in different states. With the objectives to better understand the day-to-day activities in these healthcare facilities, we learnt about their COVID-19 pandemic experiences, infection prevention practices, facility management and the primary concerns of employees as well as residents.
