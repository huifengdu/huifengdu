3D printing of materials has been widely explored for the rapid fabrication of complex soft structures and devices. Our work presents a new paradigm of designing and fabricating novel materials to meet the requirements of broad potential applications in biomedical engineering, soft robotics, and intelligent and superabsorbent devices {% cite zhang20233d %} {% cite espinosa2018engineered %} {% cite zhang2020continuous %} {% cite wu2018bioinspired %} .
