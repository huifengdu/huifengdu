We characterized in a laboratory setting the performance of an RT-qPCR-based biosensing process incorporating an electrophoretic step for nucleic acid enrichment. We opted for cost-effective technologies for each step of the process, thus making continuous monitoring in low-resource areas viable.

A simple skin-electrode mechanosensing structure (SEMS) and SEMS-based glove are constructed, exhibiting high pressure-resolution and millimeter-spatial-resolution, being capable of feeling touch and detecting weak physiological signals. This hold great promise of diverse healthcare applications, such as pulse detection and recovering the sensory capability in patients with tactile dysfunction."},{"name":"Nano-kirigami with giant optical chirality","publisher":"Science Advances","releaseDate":"2018-07-01","url":"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.aat4436","summary":"We demonstrate a one-step and on-site nano-kirigami method that avoids the prescribed multistep procedures in traditional mesoscopic kirigami or origami techniques. The demonstrated nano-kirigami, as well as the exotic 3D nanostructures, could be adopted in broad nanofabrication platforms and could open up new possibilities for the exploration of functional micro-/nanophotonic and mechanical devices."}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Proficient","icon":""},{"language":"Chinese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Biosensing","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Airborne pathogen detection","Metagenomic sequencing"]},{"name":"Manufacturing","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Projection Stereolithography","Material extrusion-based 3D printing"]},{"name":"Sensor design","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Tactile sensors","Gas detection"]}]}
