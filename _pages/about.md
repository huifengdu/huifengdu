Welcome! I am a scientist and mechanical engineer, with my research focusing on design, manufacturing and development of biosensors. I am currently working with [Prof. Domitilla Del Vecchio](https://scripts.mit.edu/~ddv/index.php) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. and M.S. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology advised by [Prof. Nicholas X. Fang](https://web.mit.edu/nanophotonics/), and my B.S. from Peking University.

My research interests are centered around the development and application of advanced materials and technologies for health and engineering. This includes the creation of fieldable biosensors for both in vitro applications and environmental health monitoring, aiming to provide real-time, on-site diagnostic capabilities. I am also deeply involved in the mechanical design and characterization of microarchitectured materials, which find multifunctional applications across structural engineering, acoustics, photonics, and biology. These materials are designed to offer unique properties through architectural design. Furthermore, my work encompasses the design and manufacturing of soft composites through additive manufacturing techniques, such as stereolithography and material extrusion. This area focuses on creating flexible, durable materials for a range of applications, leveraging the precision and versatility of 3D printing technologies.
